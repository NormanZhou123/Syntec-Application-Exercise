# Syntec Application Development Exercise

This is a vanilla JavaScript practice to show the employee list on webpage
Data API: https://emplistapi-258220.appspot.com/
Used a CSS framework called Bulma: https://bulma.io/

- Might need to change debug config to make it work
- The page is not fully responsive for now(navigation bar is not), hopefully I'll fix it later
- Drag and drop to change the order of the list
- Sort the list by first name or last name
- Click on the load more button at the bottom to see more content
- Add a new employee by clicking on the Add Employee button. Input validation is not smart for now because I'm not sure if any module is allowed, will add a validation module in the future if needed
- For employees who don't have photo url in the data set, I made a default image as alternate
